"""
Central registry for all RBAC permission code strings.

Usage:
    from apps.rbac.permission_codes import P

    class MyViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
        required_permission = P.CONTENT_MANAGEMENT.COURSE_CREATE

Rules:
    - This file is the single source of truth for permission code strings on the backend.
    - Every ViewSet, service, and test must import from here — never use raw string literals.
    - When adding a new permission, add it here first, then add it to the fixture.
    - The string values here must exactly match the permission_code values in 02_permissions.json.
